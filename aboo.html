<p>Hey my name is Abdullah Abdullaev. I am a senior at Brooklyn Tech in your Web Development class!</p> <p>I got very little interest in coding and software but an incredible dedication to getting money. I spend most of my time on Tiktok until it's late enough to start my homework which is why I usually look a little sleepy.</p> <p>I sit in the corner by Mr.Irimina and Mennua; if you're reading this just turn and awkwardly stare at Mennua for a couple seconds. He loves it!</p>
